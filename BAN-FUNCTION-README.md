# Ban Function Fixes

This document outlines the fixes implemented for the ban/unban functionality in the Lost and Found Platform.

## Issues Fixed

1. **Missing Database Column**: Added the `ban_reason` column to the Users table.
2. **Email Notifications**: Implemented server-side email notifications using Nodemailer.
3. **Security Permissions**: Fixed security user permissions to allow both banning and unbanning users.

## Scripts Created

### Database Scripts

- `add-ban-reason-column.js`: Adds the missing `ban_reason` column to the Users table.
- `db-check.js`: Checks if the `ban_reason` column exists in the Users table.

### Email Scripts

- `server-email-nodemailer.js`: Implements server-side email notifications using Nodemailer.
- `test-email-config.js`: Tests the email configuration.
- `test-ban-email.js`: Tests the ban notification email.

### Testing Scripts

- `test-ban-direct.js`: Tests the ban function directly by making an API call.
- `test-ban-unban.js`: Comprehensive test script for both ban and unban functionality.

## How to Use

### 1. Check Database Schema

```bash
node db-check.js
```

### 2. Add Missing Column (if needed)

```bash
node add-ban-reason-column.js
```

### 3. Test Email Configuration

```bash
node test-email-config.js
```

### 4. Test Ban/Unban Functionality

```bash
node test-ban-unban.js
```

## Email Configuration

The email service uses Nodemailer with Gmail. Make sure your `.env` file has the following variables:

```
EMAIL_USER=your-email@gmail.com
EMAIL_PASS=your-app-password
```

**Note**: If using Gmail, you need to use an App Password if 2FA is enabled.

## Troubleshooting

If you're still experiencing issues:

1. Check server logs for detailed error messages.
2. Verify email configuration in the `.env` file.
3. Ensure the database connection is working properly.
4. Check security user permissions in the database.

## Additional Logging

Added detailed logging for email notifications in `server.js`. Look for these log messages:

```
==== SENDING BAN EMAIL NOTIFICATION ====
==== SENDING UNBAN EMAIL NOTIFICATION ====
```
