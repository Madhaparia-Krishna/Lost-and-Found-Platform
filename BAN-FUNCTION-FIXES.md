# Ban/Unban Functionality Fixes

## Summary of Changes

We have fixed the ban/unban functionality in the Lost & Found Platform with the following changes:

1. **Created a Nodemailer-based email service** (`server-email-nodemailer.js`) to replace the browser-only EmailJS service for sending ban/unban notifications.

2. **Updated the server.js file** to use the new Nodemailer-based email service for sending ban/unban notifications.

3. **Fixed the security permissions** to allow security users to both ban and unban users.

4. **Created test scripts** to verify the ban/unban functionality and email notifications.

## Files Modified

1. `server.js` - Updated to use Nodemailer for email notifications and fixed security permissions for unban functionality.

2. `src/pages/SecurityDashboard.jsx` - Updated to allow security users to unban users.

## Files Created

1. `server-email-nodemailer.js` - New email service using Nodemailer for server-side email notifications.

2. `test-ban-function.js` - Test script to verify ban/unban functionality.

3. `test-security-ban.js` - Interactive test script for security user ban/unban functionality.

4. `EMAIL-SETUP.md` - Instructions for setting up email notifications.

## How to Test

1. Configure email settings as described in `EMAIL-SETUP.md`.

2. Restart the server:
   ```
   node server.js
   ```

3. Run the interactive test script:
   ```
   node test-security-ban.js
   ```

4. Or use the web interface:
   - Log in as a security user
   - Navigate to the Security Dashboard
   - Go to the Users tab
   - Use the Ban/Unban buttons to test the functionality

## Notes

- Both security and admin users can now ban and unban users.
- Email notifications are sent to users when they are banned or unbanned.
- The ban reason is included in the ban notification email.
- If email sending fails, the ban/unban process will still complete successfully.
